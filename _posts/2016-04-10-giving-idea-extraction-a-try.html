title:  "Giving Idea Extraction a try"

Inspired by my recent re-discovery of [the Foundation](https://thefoundation.com) by Dane Maxwell I picked myself up to start over. A critical part of the Foundation’s philosophy is the idea extraction process during which one gets to know the unsatisfied needs of a potential customer base. Based on that ideas form, products take shape and value is created for everyone involved – in theory, anyway.

It’s easy to come up with a vague idea based on some half hearted observation or any other unreliable inspiration. Action taking entrepreneurs go straight to work on it and after a week or two the project is dead. Do this over and over and you’ll feel like the biggest loser in history. Sadly, I write from experience.

Therein lays the attraction of the Foundation’s approach to finding ideas. By the time one comes up with one it’s already verified by the potential customer. No more guessing, no more self doubt, no more vagueness and perhaps even pre-sales funding the project before any concrete action has been taken. One doesn’t have to be a member of the Foundation, which I’m not, to appreciate that concept.

<h3>Let’s get to work</h3>

I decided to give the whole process a try and worked out an experimental strategy to see if this approach is right for me. If successful at least one solid idea is born.

The all important first step is to find an industry. I quickly stopped digging the web for industry reports, trends, etc. A healthy guess and some key figures (e.g. [IBISWorld](http://www.ibisworld.com/)) will have to suffice for now. Otherwise I’d probably get lost before I even left the ground.

I’ll also drop the thought of choosing multiple industries. For the sake of this experiment one will do. At this point speedy progress and learning the process is more important than ultimate success.

In step two I’ll find all the major corner stones of information regarding the industry. Industry associations, magazines, forums, influential blogs, etc. are the main targets. From that I hope to gain lists of individual businesses in the industry and get to know the whole industry from a high level perspective.

Next up will be the consolidation of actual contacts. This will be the all important list of people I’ll contact through email and cold-calls. I don’t have an actual strategy on how to do that, yet. It’s probably something I’ll have to learn along the way.

What follows is make or break time. Contacting these total strangers and pick their brains. To me this might be the biggest learning experience during this experiment. Overcoming that intense emotional roller coaster when cold calling other people and finding ways to get what I want.

I chose to make this whole process as transparent as possible. By doing so I hope to provide value to anyone looking into the concept of idea extraction themselves.
