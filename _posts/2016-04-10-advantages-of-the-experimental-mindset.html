One problem I ran into quickly when looking into idea extraction is paralysis by analysis. Worried about choosing the right industries I wasted valuable time over stuff I didn't really find or understand well. In the end I had nothing but even more self doubt. That's when I decided to care less about success and focus mostly on the process instead.

Caring deeply about your success is a good thing. But pair that with inexperience and your chances of success become abysmally small. To really succeed a certain level of skill and self confidence is required. That's why I deliberately chose to do nothing but experimental idea extraction.

Instead of worrying about all details, remove unnecessary steps. Don't worry about getting all your research right. Focus on moving forward and taking action instead. But most of all, don't expect to end up a millionaire at the end. Set a much simpler goal. Mine is to grow comfortable with the whole process of idea extraction and ultimately end up with one solid idea.

With nothing on the line I feel it's easier to relax and accept mistakes. They become harmless learning experiences and won't be made again once the going gets tougher. It's a bit like a flight simulator. Try things out, crash the plane as often as you like, go a bit crazy and ultimately learn how to handle the real thing without crashing and burning.
